GitHub Copilot Agent Mode & MCP Demo is a purpose-built showcase that demonstrates the full spectrum of GitHub's AI-assisted development capabilities within a realistic e-commerce application called OctoCat Supply.

This demo uses a modern TypeScript application with separate React frontend and a flexible backend component to illustrate how GitHub Copilot can understand, analyze, and enhance existing codebases through natural language interaction and visual understanding. At demo creation time, you can choose between Node.js, Python, .NET, or Java for the backend implementation, allowing you to showcase Copilot's capabilities in the programming language most relevant to your audience.

Technical details:

- Frontend: React 18+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- Backend: Multiple language options (Node.js/Express.js, Python, .NET, or Java)
- DevOps: Docker support for MCP servers
- Testing: Jest unit tests, Playwright for automated browser testing

Key features include:

- Agent Mode with Vision for implementing complex UI features by understanding design mockups and translating them into functional code across multiple files
- MCP Server integration that extends Copilot's capabilities with Playwright for automated browser testing and GitHub API integration
- Automated testing workflows including test generation, coverage analysis, and BDD feature file creation
- Security scanning using GitHub Advanced Security with AI-powered vulnerability detection and automated fixes
- DevOps automation through generation of GitHub Actions workflows and infrastructure as code
- Custom instructions that demonstrate how Copilot can be personalized to understand internal frameworks and coding standards
