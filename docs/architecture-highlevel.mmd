## Architecture Components

### Frontend Layer (React/Vite/Tailwind)
- **React 18+**: Modern component-based UI framework with TypeScript
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server for optimal developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and consistent styling
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for better maintainability and developer experience

### Backend Layer (Express.js API)
- **Express.js**: Node.js web framework serving RESTful API endpoints
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: API documentation and specification
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction layer for clean separation of concerns
- **Entity Models**: Business logic and data models with proper relationships
- **TAO Observability**: Custom observability framework for metrics, tracing, and logging

### Data Layer (SQLite)
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight, file-based relational database
- **Schema Migrations**: Version-controlled database schema changes
- **Seed Data**: Deterministic test and demo data population

## Communication Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the React frontend through web browsers
2. **API Communication**: Frontend makes HTTPS REST API calls to the Express.js backend
3. **Data Processing**: Backend processes requests through routes, models, and repositories
4. **Data Persistence**: Repository layer executes SQL queries against SQLite database
5. **Response Flow**: Data flows back through the same layers to the user interface

## Security Best Practices

### üîí Production Security Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Always use HTTPS in production environments to ensure encrypted communication between the frontend and backend. Never deploy with HTTP in production.

**SECRET MANAGEMENT**: Never hardcode secrets, API keys, passwords, or sensitive configuration values in source code. Use environment variables or secure secret management services.

**PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE**: Implement the principle of least privilege for all API endpoints:
- Validate and sanitize all input data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Limit API access to only necessary operations
- Use role-based access control where applicable

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Standards Reference

For comprehensive security guidelines, refer to the security instructions and standards documentation in your organization's security space. Key areas to focus on include:

- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and session management  
- Authorization and access control
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure error handling and logging
- Regular security assessments and updates

### üîç Security Monitoring

The TAO observability framework provides security monitoring capabilities:
- Request logging and audit trails
- Performance metrics and anomaly detection
- Error tracking and security event logging
- Distributed tracing for request flow analysis

## Deployment Considerations

- **Containerization**: Both frontend and backend are containerized using Docker
- **Environment Configuration**: Runtime configuration supports different deployment environments
- **Database**: SQLite provides simplicity for development and demonstration purposes
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling through container orchestration

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**: Use `npm run dev` to start both frontend and backend in development mode
2. **Database Management**: Initialize with `npm run db:init --workspace=api` for migrations and seed data
3. **Testing**: Run `npm run test:api` for backend unit tests
4. **Building**: Use `npm run build` to create production-ready builds
5. **Linting**: Ensure code quality with `npm run lint`
