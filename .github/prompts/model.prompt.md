# Choosing the right model

Use the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task] to help me select the correct models for the tasks I want to perform.

- This is for GitHub Copilot only - do not suggest using models directly
- Architecture as defined by the [architecture doc](../../docs/architecture.md)
- ask clarifying questions when necessary
- for each model summarize:
  - what the pros are of using this model
  - what the cons are of using this model
- be opinionated and at the end recommend a single model
